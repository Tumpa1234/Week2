            C programming language is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C Programming:

             Easy to learn

             Structured language

             It produces efficient programs

             It can handle low-level activities

             It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms

             <span>Facts about C</span>
             C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.

             C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.

             The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).

             The UNIX OS was totally written in C.

             Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.

             Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.
